        <h1><em><u>Post 1: Feeling Guilty About Being Sad</em></u></h1>
        <p>
        It has somehow been wired into my brain that I need to earn everything, even emotions. So whenever I feel happy or sad, unfortunately, my brain starts assessing whether or not I deserve to feel that way.
        </p>
        <p>
        When it comes to sadness, there is part of me that is convinced that I am only allowed to be sad if the situation that is making me sad is visibly terrible. For example; I can feel sad about losing a loved one, but I am not allowed to feel sad due to my extreme anxiety about the future.
        </p>
        <p>
        I am not allowed to feel sad if I am physically healthy and all my basic needs are taken care of.
        I am not allowed to feel sad due to anything caused by mental or emotional distress that is not entirely rooted in reality.
        Whenever I start feeling extremely anxious about something, it automatically comes with feelings of sadness. The sadness is usually because of my mind, at that moment, briefly steps into the terrible future I am imagining and dwells there. I become sad about a possible future event that will make me sad if I actually happen to experience it.
        </p>
        <p>
        Almost immediately, my brain starts shaming me about being sad.
        </p>
        <p>
        It reasons that my sadness makes no sense and I should be ashamed because other people in the world are sad for far more valid reasons. Since there are people who are sad for far more ‘valid’ reasons, I start feeling guilty about being sad. My brain then threatens me, telling me that if I am unable to be happy despite all the privileges I enjoy, then the universe will give me more terrible things to be sad about.
        Then my anxiety increases, and I’m sad again, and the cycle repeats.
        To break the cycle, and appease the universe for being shamelessly sad due to invalid reasons, I try my best to remember all that is good in my life and actively express how grateful I am about all of those things. In theory, being grateful for all that is good in your life should help one feel more grounded in the present and therefore less anxious about the future. In my case, this would mean I wouldn’t feel sad and I wouldn’t feel guilty about being sad.
        Unfortunately, this hasn’t always worked for me.
        </p>
        <p>
        The only explanation I have for why it doesn’t work is that using one negative emotion to counter another one is counter-intuitive. Negative emotions can’t produce positive ones, at least for me. Guilting myself into being grateful doesn’t work the same magic that being intentionally grateful does.
        Besides, while it is true that anxiety about the future can be caused due to being unhappy with one's present situation, I don’t think being grateful and wanting changes to one’s present situation are mutually exclusive. I can be grateful for the privileges I enjoy in the present moment, and still, feel sad that my present reality isn’t what I had hoped for. I can be grateful and still feel anxious.

        If my feelings are valid and not necessarily due to being an ungrateful person, why is my immediate response to them guilting myself to being grateful?

        Well-meaning advice from loved ones/friends.
        </p>
        <p>
        The most common advice I get whenever I feel anxious is something along the lines of  ‘focus on the positive’.This is great advice! Except sometimes it comes with subtle shaming of my feelings. When I’m feeling sad and anxious about something, and somebody tells me to focus on the positive by a) realizing it could be worse b) comparing my situation to a more terrible situation they have been in c) reminding me that I have it better than other people, it is telling me that my feelings are not valid. It is from such advice that my brain has formed the categories through which to assess whether my sadness is valid.

        So, where do we go from here?

        In my next post, I will be discussing some scientific findings on feelings of guilt being associated with other negative emotions and how to better deal with them.
